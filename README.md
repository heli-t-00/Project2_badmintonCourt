# Introduction 

For my second project in the tech bootcamp, I will build upon my first project, [Project 1] (https://heli-t-00.github.io/Project1_NPBadminton/), by creating an interactive badminton court using a front-end web application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project aligns with the EPIC (Easily-Accessible, Purposeful, Interactive, and Consistent) approach and aims to deliver an engaging and user-friendly experience for those who are new to badminton and want to know the badminton basics.

The primary goal is to display the rules of the game interactively, focusing on accessibility and responsivity. The application will ensure compatibility across devices by designing with a mobile-first approach. Leveraging CSS, I will implement CSS grids to construct the badminton court, ensuring scalability for various screen sizes.

# Desired Outcome
The interactive badminton court will allow users to:

- Identify specific areas of the court such as play zones or service areas.
- Learn key rules visually, such as which areas are valid for singles play or doubles play.
- Experience animations that demonstrate court usage (e.g., valid service areas).
- Interact with tooltips providing additional information about court regions.

This project intends to satisfy the following objectives:

- LO1: Design an interactive front-end web application based on UX design principles, accessibility, and responsivity.
- LO2: Test the application thoroughly during development, implementation, and deployment phases.
- LO3: Deploy the web application to a cloud platform for public access.
- LO4: Maximise future maintainability through clear documentation and organised code structure.
- LO5: Document the development process using version control tools like GitHub.
- LO6: Implement front-end interactivity using core JavaScript and advanced features.

# Proposed Features
## Interactive Badminton Court: Users can click areas of interest on the court to learn the rules.
### User Story - Single Court Player:
- As a new user, I want to...'Identify valid play areas for single player game'.
- As a new user, I want to... 'Identify service areas for single player game'.
### User Story - Double Court Players:
- As a new user, I want to... 'Identify valid play areas for double players game'.
- As a new user, I want to... 'Identify service areas for double players game'.

* Use animation, to illustrate service zones.
* Additional Feature:
    - a test for user to check whether they can identify service area
    - a test to identify areas of the court

This project will demonstrate my ability to integrate technical knowledge with design principles to create an accessible and responsive web application.

# WireFrame
When designing the website, my focus was on creating an intuitive experience. I want the users to immediately understand the purpose of the page, even if they arrived via a quick Google search. The wireframe was crafted with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices. The webpage will carry the same header and logo and theme of the first project to ensure it is a seemly transition to the court.html page.

### Design
The websiteâ€™s design prioritised on simplicity and intuitiveness, reflecting my goal to create a seamless and engaging user experience. Guided by core UX design principles, I focused on building an interactive front-end web application that is accessible, responsive, and user-friendly:

User-Centered Design: 
The website is tailored to the needs and behaviors of its target audience, ensuring that every feature and interaction aligns with user expectations. 
Clarity and Consistency: 
The layout is clean and organized, with readable typography, intuitive navigation, and a uniform style. This consistency helps users quickly recognize patterns and feel confident in their interactions.
Accessibility: 
Every element of the site is designed to be inclusive, meeting accessibility standards. Features such as descriptive alt text for images, high-contrast color schemes, and keyboard navigability ensure the website is usable for people of all abilities. The website responds to touch / mouse / keyboard events.
Responsiveness: 
An attempt has been made to allow the website to be responsive. 
Feedback and Usability: 
Interactive elements provide immediate feedback, such as hover effects and form submission confirmations, ensuring users understand the outcomes of their actions. Usability testing further refined the design, eliminating pain points to enhance the overall experience.
Simplicity and Findability: 
By eliminating unnecessary complexity, the website highlights essential features and makes navigation straightforward. Clear categorization and search functionality help users easily locate the information they need.
This deliberate approach to design ensured that the website not only met its primary objective of interactivity but also delivered an intuitive, inclusive, and aesthetically pleasing experience grounded in UX best practices.

### Testing
To ensure all features work as intended. The following test was performed

### Responsive
The website used [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://heli-t-00.github.io/Project2_badmintonCourt/)
<img src="assets/images/amiresponsive_p3.PNG">

### Browser Friendly
The site has been tested for the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, and Tor Browser.

Checked use this [Browserling.com]

#### CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official validator - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator). The document validates as CSS level 3 + SVG.

There were warnings, which has been checked and resolved."vendor extesnion" means that the property is specific to a particular browser engine.

### GitHub and Deployment
I have used GitHub to deploy the website. [Live Link](https://heli-t-00.github.io/Project2_badmintonCourt/)
Visual Studio Code editor from Microsoft to write the codes and linked to GitHub for deployment. 
Deploy the web application to a cloud platform for public access via [github](https://github.com/heli-t-00/Project2_badmintonCourt)
Maximised future maintainability through clear documentation (this readme file) and organised code structure, the three tech stack used, html, css and javascript has their own files and each has clear comments to allow future maintainability.

### Future Improvements
Here are future feature ideas to further improvements on this project:

- Enhanced Content: Expand on badminton rules to make the site a comprehensive learning resource.
- Responsive Design: Ensure layouts adapt seamlessly for mobile users.
- Interactive Features: Add animations, quizzes, and labeled court areas for better understanding.
- Visual Clarity: Use high-contrast colors and larger fonts for improved readability.
- Gamification: Implement levels or rewards to keep learners engaged.
- Accessibility: Support keyboard navigation and screen readers to make the site inclusive.
