# Project2_badmintonCourt

Introduction to Project 2

For my second project in the tech bootcamp, I will build upon my first project, Project 1, by creating an interactive badminton court using a front-end web application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aligns with the EPIC (Easily-Accessible, Purposeful, Interactive, and Consistent) approach and aims to deliver an engaging and user-friendly experience.

The primary goal is to display the rules of the game interactively, focusing on accessibility and responsivity. The application will ensure compatibility across devices by designing with a mobile-first approach. Leveraging CSS, I will implement CSS grids to construct the badminton court, ensuring scalability for various screen sizes.

Desired Outcome
The interactive badminton court will allow users to:

Identify specific areas of the court such as play zones or service areas.
Learn key rules visually, such as which areas are valid for singles play.
Experience animations that demonstrate court usage (e.g., valid service areas).
Interact with tooltips providing additional information about court regions.
Alignment with Learning Objectives
This project satisfies the following objectives:

LO1: Design an interactive front-end web application based on UX design principles, accessibility, and responsivity.
LO2: Test the application thoroughly during development, implementation, and deployment phases.
LO3: Deploy the web application to a cloud platform for public access.
LO4: Maximise future maintainability through clear documentation and organised code structure.
LO5: Document the development process using version control tools like GitHub.
LO6: Implement front-end interactivity using core JavaScript and advanced features (e.g., tooltips and animations).
Proposed Features
Building on the existing website (link to Project 1), I will introduce the following:

Interactive Badminton Court: Users can click areas of interest on the court to learn the rules.
User Story - Singles Players:
Identify valid play areas for singles games.
Identify service areas for singles.
See an animation illustrating service zones.
Tooltips with additional explanations for each area.
This project will demonstrate my ability to integrate technical knowledge with design principles to create an accessible and responsive web application.
